## Challenges

This was definitely challenging. I spent a lot of time first thinking through the problem as purely event driven, which it is but I started with Event handlers for everything which made my code escalate in complexion pretty quickly! Had to stop and rethink a simpler method to write the program and it works but there can definitely be some improvements!
  
## Assignment Details 

Modify starter code provided to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.
